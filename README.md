# cowbody-werewolf-game
A very basic card-based game for the web. Themed after the Old West, the Cowboys (the good guys) must find out who the Outlaw (the bad guy) is by using the hints and evidence provided each round. The Outlaws must eliminate the players and be the only one left standing, by ‘killing’ someone each round.

Steps/Rules:

1. Player chooses level (easy- 6 rounds, medium- 5 rounds, hard- 4 rounds)
2. Story prompt ("The Sheriff is dead! It's your job as the deputy to figure out who did it!")
3. Player is given one piece of evidence and one hint
4. Player selects who they beleive the killer is based on the evidence and hint
5. a)If correct they win! b)If incorrect a new round begins and the killer gets closer to killing the Player (small tracker that increases each round?)
6. Steps 3-5 repeat until the Player wins or is killed by the killer
