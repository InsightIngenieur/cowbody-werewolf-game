# cowbody-werewolf-game
A very basic card-based game for the web. Themed after the Old West, the Cowboys (the good guys) must find out who the Outlaw (the bad guy) is by using the hints and evidence provided each round. The Outlaws must eliminate the players and be the only one left standing, by ‘killing’ someone each round.
