# cowbody-werewolf-game
A very basic card-based game for the web. Themed after the Old West.

Objective:
The Sheriff is dead, and the Deputy must find out who the Outlaw (the killer) is by using the hints and evidence provided each round. But watch out! because each round the Outlaw gets closer to killing the Deputy.

Steps/Rules:

1. Player chooses level (easy- 6 rounds, medium- 5 rounds, hard- 4 rounds)
2. Story prompt ("The Sheriff is dead! It's your job as the deputy to figure out who did it!")
3. Player is given one piece of evidence and one hint
4. Player selects who they beleive the Outlaw is based on the evidence and hint
5. a)If correct they win! b)If incorrect a new round begins and the Outlaw gets closer to killing the Player (small tracker that increases each round?)
6. Steps 3-5 repeat until the Player wins or is killed by the Outlaw
